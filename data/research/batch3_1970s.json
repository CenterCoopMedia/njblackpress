It should not be confused with the nationally known PBS television program 'Black Journal' (1968-1977) hosted by Tony Brown, which later became 'Tony Brown's Journal.' The Jersey City Free Public Library's local history collections and the New Jersey Historical Society in Newark may hold physical records. The publication was likely a small-circulation community newspaper serving Jersey City's Black population during the late 1970s."

      "historicalNotes": "No digitized archive was found for En Avant, a Haitian diaspora publication from Newark, NJ (1972). 'En Avant' translates from French as 'Forward' or 'Onward.' Newark's Essex County has one of the largest Haitian communities in New Jersey, concentrated in the Vailsburg section and surrounding cities of Irvington, Orange, and East Orange. The early 1970s saw significant Haitian migration to the Northeast US fleeing the Duvalier dictatorships. Over 72 percent of New Jersey's Haitian population lives within the Archdiocese of Newark. The publication likely served as a community voice for Haitian immigrants during this wave of political exile. Known Haitian diaspora newspapers in the region include Haiti Liberte, which distributes in Newark, and The Haitian Times (founded 1999, Brooklyn). En Avant predates these and may be among the earliest Haitian community publications in New Jersey. The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at NYPL and university archives specializing in Caribbean diaspora history may hold records."

      "historicalNotes": "The Black Women's United Front (BWUF) was formally established on January 25, 1975, in Detroit, when over 500 activists from organizations including the Congress of African People (CAP), Youth Organization for Black Unity (YOBU), and the National Welfare Rights Organization came together. The BWUF was spearheaded by Amina Baraka (Sylvia Jones), wife of Amiri Baraka, who had led discussions about gender roles within CAP's Women's Division. Following the July 1974 All-Afrikan Women's Conference in Newark, NJ, Amina led over 800 men and women in forming the BWUF to develop 'an autonomous political and ideological agenda for African American women.' The organization committed to the 'abolition of every possibility of oppression & exploitation' and described itself as anti-racist, anti-capitalist, and anti-imperialist, rooted in working-class women. BWUF activities included political education forums, coalition building, support for the Joan Little case, and community forums on workplace rights, healthcare, and childcare. The BWUF published through Unity and Struggle rather than a standalone newsletter. Archival materials (1975-1976) are held in Series VII of the Komozi Woodard Amiri Baraka Collection at the Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American Culture and History, and are available on microfilm. Additional materials are accessible through the ProQuest History Vault (Penn Libraries) and the Bodleian Library at Oxford. Scholar Ashley Farmer's book 'Remaking Black Power: How Black Women Transformed an Era' draws extensively on these archives. The scholarly article 'Abolition of Every Possibility of Oppression: Black Women, Black Power, and the Black Women's United Front, 1970-1976' (Project MUSE) provides detailed analysis."

The publication does not appear in the Newark Public Library microfilm inventory, the Library of Congress directory, or standard African American newspaper bibliographies accessed online. Newark had an active Black health advocacy community during this period; the Concerned Black Nurses of Newark was formed to advocate healthcare for the underserved, and the Newark Public Library curated an exhibit titled 'Dear & Glorious Physician: The History of Black Doctors, Nurses and Hospitals in Newark and Places Just Beyond the River.' The 1970s saw Black communities organizing neighborhood health clinics and demonstration projects to address epidemics of hypertension, diabetes, and infant mortality. MEDIC News may have been connected to one of these community health initiatives. The Newark Public Library's New Jersey Information Center and the Rutgers Special Collections may hold physical copies."

'Kuumba' is a Swahili word meaning 'creativity,' one of the seven principles of Kwanzaa (Nguzo Saba). The name was widely adopted by Black student organizations and cultural groups during the 1970s Black Arts and Black Power movements. During this period, Rutgers University-New Brunswick had an active Black student community; the Black Voice Carta Latina (BVCL) was a later Black/Hispanic student publication at Rutgers, suggesting a lineage of Black student media on campus. The Scarlet & Black Research Center at Rutgers documents Black voices at the university and may have records. Rutgers University Special Collections and University Archives would be the most likely repository for this student publication. Livingston College, established in 1969 as Rutgers' most diverse residential college, was a hub for Black student activism and publications during this era."

'Ujamaa' is a Swahili word meaning 'cooperative economics' or 'familyhood,' one of the seven principles of Kwanzaa. In 1971, the institution became The William Paterson College of New Jersey, so this publication dates to that transitional year. The name 'Ujamaa' was widely used by Black Student Unions at universities across the country during this era, including Stanford, George Mason, and Evergreen State College. William Paterson's Black Student Union remains active, hosting events such as the annual Black Graduation Ceremony through the Black Cultural Center. The William Paterson University Library Special Collections would be the most likely repository for archival copies of this student journal."

East Orange, in Essex County, had a growing African American population during the 1970s and was served by several Black publications. The Essex Forum (est. 1972) was a biweekly Black newspaper serving Orange, Montclair, and East Orange during the same period. The broader Essex County area was also served by the New Jersey Afro American (Newark, 1941-1991) and the Baraka-era publications (Black NewArk, Unity and Struggle). The East Orange Public Library and the Newark Public Library's New Jersey Information Center (973-733-7775, njreference@npl.org) may hold physical copies.

It is also distinct from William Lloyd Garrison's abolitionist newspaper The Liberator (1831-1865) and Jefferson Lewis Edmonds's Los Angeles-based The Liberator (1900-1914). The Edison, NJ publication does not appear in the Library of Congress directory, the New Jersey State Library's digitized newspaper guides for Middlesex County, or the Wikipedia list of African American newspapers in New Jersey.

      "historicalNotes": "No digitized archive or detailed record was found for the Monthly Black Periodicals Selection Review from Newark, NJ (1973). The title suggests this was a library or bibliographic review publication that surveyed and recommended Black periodicals for library acquisition, rather than a community newspaper. Newark was home to several major library and information science institutions during this period. The Newark Public Library's Charles F. Cummings New Jersey Information Center maintains extensive archives and may have been connected to this publication. The 1970s saw a significant expansion of Black studies programs and library collections focused on African American materials, which would have created demand for a periodicals selection guide. This publication may be cataloged in library science databases or held in special collections at library schools."

      "historicalNotes": "Unity and Struggle was the national newspaper of the Congress of Afrikan People (CAP), led by Amiri Baraka. It evolved from earlier Newark Black publications: Black Newark (1968), Black News (1969), and Black New Ark (1972-1973), all published by the Committee for Unified Newark (CFUN). Unity and Struggle was issued by CAP from approximately February/March 1974 through April 1976, then by the Revolutionary Communist League (Marxist-Leninist-Mao Tse Tung Thought) from June 1976 through 1979, reflecting CAP's ideological transition from Black cultural nationalism to Marxism-Leninism. Dr. Komozi Woodard (professor of American history at Sarah Lawrence College and author of 'A Nation Within: Baraka and Black Power Politics') served as editor. The paper covered topics including African liberation, trade unions, factory organizing, and Black political conventions. The August 1974 issue featured coverage of the All-Afrikan Women's Conference held in Newark. The history of CAP was first published in Vol. V, No. 6 (June 1976). Digitized issues are available through the Rutgers Dana Library Newark Black Newspapers Collection (collections.libraries.rutgers.edu/newark-black-newspapers) and individual issues through RiseUp Newark (riseupnewark.com), with credit to the NYU Tamiment Library. Physical copies are held at the Komozi Woodard Amiri Baraka Collection at the Auburn Avenue Research Library, with a distribution list from 1975 preserved in the archive."

      "historicalNotes": "CFUN News was the newsletter/newspaper of the Committee for Unified Newark (CFUN), the Black united front organization chaired by Amiri Baraka from 1968 to 1975. CFUN's primary publication was Black NewArk, first published in April 1968 as one of several media outlets Baraka developed to promote Black cultural nationalism. CFUN was formed after Ron Karenga and the US organization visited Baraka's Spirit House in Newark in 1967, driving a shift toward electoral organizing that led to the election of Newark's first Black mayor, Kenneth Gibson, in 1970. CFUN also operated a 'Black Newark' radio program on Newark Public Radio (c. 1970-72) where Baraka discussed topics from teachers' strikes to the origins of Kwanzaa. The publication sequence ran: Black Newark (Vol. 1, No. 1-3, April-November 1968), Black News (Vol. 1, No. 4, 1969), Black New Ark (Vol. 1, No. 5, April 1972 through Vol. 2, No. 14, December 1973), then Unity and Struggle (Vol. 3, No. 1, January/February 1974 onward). Digitized issues are in the Rutgers Dana Library Newark Black Newspapers Collection. Additional archival materials are in the Komozi Woodard Amiri Baraka Collection (Series IV, Box 3, Folder 6) at the Auburn Avenue Research Library, the Amiri Baraka Papers at Columbia University, and the George Washington University collection (1951-1988). The scholarly article 'Putting the Black Ink Back into Print: Black Newark/Black New Ark' by Jennifer Caroccio Maldonado (NJS: An Interdisciplinary Journal, Winter 2022) examines the publication's significance."

      "historicalNotes": "Right On! was the first original fan magazine catering to an African American teen audience, launched in October 1971 by the Laufer Publishing Company. Its first cover stars were The Jackson 5 (Michael, Jermaine, Tito, Jackie, and Marlon Jackson). The magazine was a companion to the white-audience teen magazines Tiger Beat and Bop. Cynthia Horner joined in 1976 as Editorial Director and shaped the magazine's identity for decades, becoming its most notable editor-in-chief. Right On! spawned spinoffs including Word Up! (headquartered in Paramus, NJ, in Bergen County) and Black Beat, all known for centerfold-style pull-out posters. In the 1980s, Right On! became the first publication to cover hip-hop, with stories on The Sugarhill Gang, Grandmaster Flash, and The Furious Five. In the 1990s, the magazine passed through the Sterling/Macfadden publishing conglomerate (formed 1991-1992 when Macfadden's consumer magazines merged with Sterling's Magazines). In 1998, the youth music titles were sold to Primedia; the remaining titles were bought by Dorchester Media in 2004. Right On! ceased regular print publication in 2014. In 2017, Right On! Media Holdings, LLC was formed by Cynthia Horner (CEO), Derrick Horner (Chief Digital Officer), and Kenneth Harris (Chief Marketing Officer) to relaunch as Right On! Digital (rightondigital.com). The Cresskill, NJ listing may reflect a Bergen County office location, as the spinoff Word Up! was based in nearby Paramus, NJ. Some individual issues are available on Internet Archive."

      "historicalNotes": "The Black Voice was a Newark, NJ publication active from approximately 1972 to 1976, published by the United Black Workers, according to the Newark Public Library's inventory of New Jersey newspapers on microfilm. The publication is held on microfilm at the Newark Public Library's Charles F. Cummings New Jersey Information Center. As a labor-affiliated Black publication, it served a distinct niche from the Baraka-era cultural nationalist newspapers (Black NewArk, Unity and Struggle) that were active in Newark during the same period. The 1970s saw significant Black labor organizing in Newark and New Jersey, with community control of construction projects and War on Poverty programs becoming central to Black economic self-determination. This should not be confused with the Black Voice News of Riverside, California (est. 1972), The Black Voice at Syracuse University (student publication, est. 1969), or the later Rutgers Black Voice Carta Latina (BVCL) student publication.

      "historicalNotes": "No digitized archive was found for Fire II from Trenton, NJ (1975). The title is a direct homage to Fire!! A Quarterly Devoted to the Younger Negro Artists, the landmark Harlem Renaissance literary magazine published in 1926 by Wallace Thurman, Zora Neale Hurston, Aaron Douglas, Langston Hughes, Richard Bruce Nugent, Gwendolyn Bennett, and Countee Cullen. The original Fire!! lasted only one issue due to financial problems and a fire that destroyed remaining copies, but it became one of the most significant publications of the Harlem Renaissance for its unflinching treatment of Black life and its challenge to older Black literary conventions. Hughes wrote that the name was intended 'to burn up a lot of the old, dead conventional Negro-white ideas of the past.' Fire II from Trenton (1975) would have emerged during the Black Arts Movement, which explicitly drew inspiration from the Harlem Renaissance. A reprint of the original Fire!! was issued by Negro University Press in Westport, CT (1970) and by FIRE!! Press in Metuchen, NJ (1982), indicating strong New Jersey connections to preserving this legacy. The modern FIYAH Literary Magazine (speculative fiction) also draws on this lineage. Trenton had one of New Jersey's oldest Black communities, with The Sentinel (est. 1880) being among the first African American newspapers in the state."
