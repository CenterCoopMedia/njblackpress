The Connection was published by Ralph F. Johnson. The newspaper served Bergen County and northern New Jersey's Black community, providing local news coverage from a Black perspective during a period when Teaneck was one of the first communities in the nation to voluntarily desegregate its schools (1965).

Herbert asserted the paper stood for 'earnest advocacy of the broadest freedom and purest liberty for white men, black men, Chinamen, and all men alike.' Advertisers included the Irish National Land & Industrial League, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the local National Guard regiment, and the local Grand Army of the Republic chapter. The Sentinel later merged with the Trenton Herald at 4 North Broad Street. Herbert was a native of Trenton, son of Mansfield Herbert, a cabinet maker and artistic picture framer (whose clients included John A. Roebling). Henri's sister Priscilla Herbert was the first African American to graduate from the State Normal School (now College of New Jersey) in 1879. Issues were digitized from microfilm created by the Committee on Negro Studies of the American Council of Learned Societies and are available through Chronicling America.",

The publication sequence was: Black Newark (Vol. 1, Nos. 1-3, April-November 1968), then Black News (Vol. 1, No. 4, 1969, published by Black People of Newark), then Black New Ark (Vol. 1, No. 5, April 1972 through Vol. 2, No. 14, December 1973, published by CFUN), and finally Unity and Struggle (Vol. 3, No. 1, January/February 1974 through Vol. 8, No. 1/2, February 1979, published by CFUN as the national newspaper of the Congress of Afrikan People). These newspapers were published through the post-rebellion period of Newark, serving as tools for organizing and advocating for Black liberation and political and economic agency for Newark's majority Black citizenry. Baraka served as chairman of CFUN from 1968 to 1975. The movement documented in these papers contributed to the Black and Puerto Rican alliance that led to the election of Newark's first Black mayor, Kenneth Gibson, in 1970. The newspapers also covered Baraka's community-based initiatives addressing housing conditions, failing schools, and economic opportunities, including the Kawaida Towers apartment project and NJR-32 urban renewal project. The collection is digitized and searchable through the Rutgers Dana Library Newark Black Newspapers Collection. Additional copies are held at the NYU Tamiment Library and the Auburn Avenue Research Library. Scholarly treatment includes Jennifer Caroccio Maldonado's article 'Putting the Black Ink Back into Print: Black Newark/Black New Ark' in New Jersey Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal 8(1), Winter 2022, pp. 34-49.",

Publishers listed as Rock and Howard. Relocated from Long Branch to Red Bank in 1909, established with capital of $50. Rock died in June 1933 and the paper folded in 1943.

      "historicalNotes": "The New Jersey Afro-American was the Newark regional edition of the Baltimore-based Afro-American newspaper chain, one of the most influential African American newspaper enterprises in the United States. Published weekly by the Afro-American Company from Vol. 1, No. 1 (March 15, 1941) through 1991, it served the African American communities of Newark and East Orange in Essex County, New Jersey. The parent Afro-American newspaper was founded in 1892 by John H. Murphy Sr. in Baltimore and expanded under editor Carl J. Murphy (who led the paper for 45 years starting in 1922) to include nine national editions in 13 major cities. At its peak, regional weekly editions were published in Baltimore, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, Richmond, and Newark. The chain employed notable journalists and intellectuals including Langston Hughes, William Worthy, and J. Saunders Redding. It was the first Black newspaper to employ a female sportswriter (Lillian Johnson and Nell Dodson in the mid-1930s), and artist Romare Bearden began his career as a cartoonist there in 1936. During World War II, the Afro-American stationed reporters in Europe, the Aleutians, Africa, Japan, and other parts of the South Pacific; Elizabeth Murphy Phillips Moss was the first Black female war correspondent. The New Jersey edition adopted Afro-American numeration in 1979. Princeton University Library holds microfilm copies from March 15, 1941 through 1972. The parent Afro-American remains in publication today as the oldest family-owned African American newspaper in the United States. LCCN: sn84025926.",

      "historicalNotes": "CFUN News was the newsletter/newspaper of the Committee for Unified Newark (CFUN), the Black united front organization chaired by Amiri Baraka from 1968 to 1975. CFUN's primary publication was Black NewArk, first published in April 1968 as one of several media outlets Baraka developed to promote Black cultural nationalism. CFUN was formed after Ron Karenga and the US organization visited Baraka's Spirit House in Newark in 1967, driving a shift toward electoral organizing that led to the election of Newark's first Black mayor, Kenneth Gibson, in 1970. CFUN also operated a 'Black Newark' radio program on Newark Public Radio (c. 1970-72) where Baraka discussed topics from teachers' strikes to the origins of Kwanzaa. The publication sequence ran: Black Newark (Vol. 1, No. 1-3, April-November 1968), Black News (Vol. 1, No. 4, 1969), Black New Ark (Vol. 1, No. 5, April 1972 through Vol. 2, No. 14, December 1973), then Unity and Struggle (Vol. 3, No. 1, January/February 1974 onward). Digitized issues are in the Rutgers Dana Library Newark Black Newspapers Collection. Additional archival materials are in the Komozi Woodard Amiri Baraka Collection (Series IV, Box 3, Folder 6) at the Auburn Avenue Research Library, the Amiri Baraka Papers at Columbia University, and the George Washington University collection (1951-1988). The scholarly article 'Putting the Black Ink Back into Print: Black Newark/Black New Ark' by Jennifer Caroccio Maldonado (NJS: An Interdisciplinary Journal, Winter 2022) examines the publication's significance.",

      "historicalNotes": "Student newspaper of the Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth at Bordentown (the 'Bordentown School'), also known as 'the Tuskegee of the North.' The school was founded in 1886 (originally 1876) by Rev. Walter A. Rice, a former slave and AME Church minister, beginning with 10 students in two wood-clapboard homes on West Street. The name 'Ironsides' derives from the school's location on the former estate of Commodore Charles Stewart, commander of the USS Constitution ('Old Ironsides') during the War of 1812. Frances O. Grant founded the drama club and The Ironsides Echo, which won multiple prizes from organizations including the National Scholastic Association. Grant invited prominent figures including Mary McLeod Bethune, W.E.B. Du Bois, James Weldon Johnson, Paul Robeson, Albert Einstein, and Eleanor Roosevelt to speak at the school. The paper was printed by students in the printing trades program and served as outreach -- both white and Black schools exchanged papers with them. The front page of the May-June 1939 edition announced Mary McLeod Bethune as Commencement Speaker. William R. Valentine became principal in 1915, viewing the school as offering practical education, stating: 'We cannot all be doctors, lawyers, dentists, and preachers... Thus the need of men in the trades.' The school closed in 1955 following the Brown v. Board of Education decision. Digitized issues (from 1935 onward) available through the New Jersey State Library's DSpace repository.",

The early 1970s saw significant Haitian migration to the Northeast US fleeing the Duvalier dictatorships. Over 72 percent of New Jersey's Haitian population lives within the Archdiocese of Newark. The publication likely served as a community voice for Haitian immigrants during this wave of political exile. Known Haitian diaspora newspapers in the region include Haiti Liberte, which distributes in Newark, and The Haitian Times (founded 1999, Brooklyn). En Avant predates these and may be among the earliest Haitian community publications in New Jersey.

      "historicalNotes": "The Black Women's United Front (BWUF) was formally established on January 25, 1975, in Detroit, when over 500 activists from organizations including the Congress of African People (CAP), Youth Organization for Black Unity (YOBU), and the National Welfare Rights Organization came together. The BWUF was spearheaded by Amina Baraka (Sylvia Jones), wife of Amiri Baraka, who had led discussions about gender roles within CAP's Women's Division. Following the July 1974 All-Afrikan Women's Conference in Newark, NJ, Amina led over 800 men and women in forming the BWUF to develop 'an autonomous political and ideological agenda for African American women.' The organization committed to the 'abolition of every possibility of oppression & exploitation' and described itself as anti-racist, anti-capitalist, and anti-imperialist, rooted in working-class women. BWUF activities included political education forums, coalition building, support for the Joan Little case, and community forums on workplace rights, healthcare, and childcare. The BWUF published through Unity and Struggle rather than a standalone newsletter. Archival materials (1975-1976) are held in Series VII of the Komozi Woodard Amiri Baraka Collection at the Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American Culture and History, and are available on microfilm. Additional materials are accessible through the ProQuest History Vault (Penn Libraries) and the Bodleian Library at Oxford. Scholar Ashley Farmer's book 'Remaking Black Power: How Black Women Transformed an Era' draws extensively on these archives. The scholarly article 'Abolition of Every Possibility of Oppression: Black Women, Black Power, and the Black Women's United Front, 1970-1976' (Project MUSE) provides detailed analysis.",

The publication is connected to Baraka's Black Nationalist period, following his move from Greenwich Village to Newark in 1965 and the founding of the Spirit House theater. It was published in the same year that Baraka's Jihad Productions in Newark published his poetry collection 'Black Art,' the first volume of the three-part work 'Black Magic: Poems 1961-66.'

      "historicalNotes": "Bronze Thrills was a Black romance and confessions-style magazine that evolved from The World's Messenger, founded in 1942 by Horace J. Blackwell, an African American minister and clothing merchant in Fort Worth, Texas. After Blackwell's death in 1949, his widow sold the publication to George T. Levitan, a white businessman, who renamed it Bronze Thrills and continued publishing through Good Publishing Company (also known as Sepia Publishing), based in Fort Worth. Good Publishing also produced the magazines Sepia, Hep, and Jive for African American audiences. Bronze Thrills featured true romance, true confessions, and women's interest articles alongside essays on African American issues. While Sepia did not equal the newsstand sales of Bronze Thrills, it was Sepia that became the most successful competitor to Ebony for nearly four decades. After Levitan's death in 1976, the publications were sold to Beatrice Pringle, returning them to Black ownership. The business closed around 1983. Note: All available sources identify Fort Worth, Texas as the base of Good Publishing. The connection to Dover, New Jersey may reflect a regional editorial or distribution office, but this could not be confirmed through online sources. The magazine's records and building were mostly destroyed after the business closed; the African American Museum in Dallas now holds the picture files.",

Published by Baraka's Newark-based Jihad Productions, it was a mimeographed experimental music magazine that ran for four issues. The Cricket emerged from the heart of the Black Arts Movement, published shortly after the 1967 Newark Rebellion. Over its four issues, it laid out an anticommercial ideology and took aim at the conservative jazz press, providing space for critics, poets, journalists, and musicians to devise new styles of music writing. It ran poetry, position papers, and gossip alongside concert and record reviews and essays on music and politics. Contributors included Albert Ayler, Milford Graves, Sun Ra, Cecil Taylor, Stanley Crouch, Haki Madhubuti (Don L. Lee), Ishmael Reed, Sonia Sanchez, Keorapetse Kgositsile, Mtume, Black Unity Trio, Ben Caldwell, Askia Muhammad Toure, and many others. The fourth issue (1969) is particularly notable for containing Albert Ayler's letter 'To Mr. Jones -- I had a Vision,' describing an intense UFO sighting/religious revelation Ayler and his brother experienced in New Jersey. The complete facsimile of all four issues was republished by Blank Forms Editions with an introduction by poet and scholar David Grundy, author of 'A Black Arts Poetry Machine: Amiri Baraka and the Umbra Poets' (Bloomsbury Academic, 2019).",

On October 2, 1972, the first issue of the combined Utimme Umana: La Voz Oculta was published, merging the Black student paper with a Hispanic voice. 'Utimme Umana' means 'rebirth' in Swahili, while 'La Voz Oculta' means 'the hidden voice' in Spanish. The paper's defining mission was to combat ignorance on the topics of race and it encouraged readers to help spread the word. The publication presented poetry, short stories, and essays relating predominantly to Black, Hispanic, and Latinx themes, along with social and cultural events, announcements, reviews, letters to the editor, photographs, and drawings. It was published twice monthly in newspaper format until early 1978 when it changed to a magazine format, with issues averaging 30 pages. The publication ran from 1972 to 1990. Its founding was part of a broader movement at Trenton State College where, following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968, African American students presented a list of 10 demands to President Robert Heussler, including creation of an Afro-American Studies program, increased Black student enrollment, hiring Black entertainment, and having a dedicated space on campus for Black students.

      "historicalNotes": "The Newark Community Union Project (NCUP) was established in 1964 as part of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) Economic Research and Action Project (ERAP), co-led by Tom Hayden and Carl Wittman. NCUP settled into the Clinton Hill neighborhood in South Newark in the summer of 1964, consisting of about 12-15 organizers (half Black, half white college students and graduates). While a specific newsletter titled 'NCUP News' was not confirmed in online sources, NCUP produced community publications and flyers as part of its organizing work in the predominantly Black Clinton Hill neighborhood. The project focused on housing issues, organizing rent strikes (which were illegal in New Jersey), picketing slumlords' homes, and conducting block meetings to address rats, roaches, unsafe living conditions, and police misconduct. NCUP's work is documented in the 1966 documentary film 'Troublemakers.' By late summer 1965, the project staff had dwindled to about half a dozen organizers, though an estimated 150 local people participated in various programs and meetings. The 1967 Newark Rebellion effectively ended NCUP, as the uprising convinced the remaining white organizers they were unwanted. NCUP's methods -- rent strikes, picketing, block meetings -- had by then spread to other parts of the city. Archival materials may exist at the NYU Tamiment Library, Rutgers University Libraries, or the Library of Congress, which catalogs materials under the subject heading 'Newark Community Union Project (N.J.)'.",

A Quarterly Devoted to the Younger Negro Artists, the landmark Harlem Renaissance literary magazine published in 1926 by Wallace Thurman, Zora Neale Hurston, Aaron Douglas, Langston Hughes, Richard Bruce Nugent, Gwendolyn Bennett, and Countee Cullen. The original Fire!! lasted only one issue due to financial problems and a fire that destroyed remaining copies, but it became one of the most significant publications of the Harlem Renaissance for its unflinching treatment of Black life and its challenge to older Black literary conventions. Hughes wrote that the name was intended 'to burn up a lot of the old, dead conventional Negro-white ideas of the past.' Fire II from Trenton (1975) would have emerged during the Black Arts Movement, which explicitly drew inspiration from the Harlem Renaissance. A reprint of the original Fire!! was issued by Negro University Press in Westport, CT (1970) and by FIRE!! Press in Metuchen, NJ (1982), indicating strong New Jersey connections to preserving this legacy. The modern FIYAH Literary Magazine (speculative fiction) also draws on this lineage. Trenton had one of New Jersey's oldest Black communities, with The Sentinel (est. 1880) being among the first African American newspapers in the state.",

Publisher Scott Figman greenlit the standalone magazine after the hairstyle sections proved enormously popular. Hype Hair became the #1 hair and beauty publication for women of color, published nine times per year featuring hairstyles, beauty products, and celebrity coverage. The magazine was Black women-led since its founding but was only Black-owned from 2013-2017 under UPTOWN Ventures Group. In 2021, Lia Dias (owner of The Girl Cave LA beauty supply stores) purchased the magazine, making it Black-owned again. Dias merged her beauty supply chain with the brand to launch Hype Hair Beauty Supply stores in California and Texas. The magazine is now digital-only, headquartered in Los Angeles.",

It evolved from earlier Newark Black publications: Black Newark (1968), Black News (1969), and Black New Ark (1972-1973), all published by the Committee for Unified Newark (CFUN). Unity and Struggle was issued by CAP from approximately February/March 1974 through April 1976, then by the Revolutionary Communist League (Marxist-Leninist-Mao Tse Tung Thought) from June 1976 through 1979, reflecting CAP's ideological transition from Black cultural nationalism to Marxism-Leninism. Dr. Komozi Woodard (professor of American history at Sarah Lawrence College and author of 'A Nation Within: Baraka and Black Power Politics') served as editor. The paper covered topics including African liberation, trade unions, factory organizing, and Black political conventions. The August 1974 issue featured coverage of the All-Afrikan Women's Conference held in Newark. The history of CAP was first published in Vol. V, No. 6 (June 1976). Digitized issues are available through the Rutgers Dana Library Newark Black Newspapers Collection (collections.libraries.rutgers.edu/newark-black-newspapers) and individual issues through RiseUp Newark (riseupnewark.com), with credit to the NYU Tamiment Library. Physical copies are held at the Komozi Woodard Amiri Baraka Collection at the Auburn Avenue Research Library, with a distribution list from 1975 preserved in the archive.",

Its first cover stars were The Jackson 5 (Michael, Jermaine, Tito, Jackie, and Marlon Jackson). The magazine was a companion to the white-audience teen magazines Tiger Beat and Bop. Cynthia Horner joined in 1976 as Editorial Director and shaped the magazine's identity for decades, becoming its most notable editor-in-chief. Right On! spawned spinoffs including Word Up! (headquartered in Paramus, NJ, in Bergen County) and Black Beat, all known for centerfold-style pull-out posters. In the 1980s, Right On! became the first publication to cover hip-hop, with stories on The Sugarhill Gang, Grandmaster Flash, and The Furious Five. In the 1990s, the magazine passed through the Sterling/Macfadden publishing conglomerate (formed 1991-1992 when Macfadden's consumer magazines merged with Sterling's Magazines). In 1998, the youth music titles were sold to Primedia; the remaining titles were bought by Dorchester Media in 2004. Right On! ceased regular print publication in 2014. In 2017, Right On! Media Holdings, LLC was formed by Cynthia Horner (CEO), Derrick Horner (Chief Digital Officer), and Kenneth Harris (Chief Marketing Officer) to relaunch as Right On! Digital (rightondigital.com). The Cresskill, NJ listing may reflect a Bergen County office location, as the spinoff Word Up! was based in nearby Paramus, NJ. Some individual issues are available on Internet Archive.",

'Kuumba' is a Swahili word meaning 'creativity,' one of the seven principles of Kwanzaa (Nguzo Saba). The name was widely adopted by Black student organizations and cultural groups during the 1970s Black Arts and Black Power movements. During this period, Rutgers University-New Brunswick had an active Black student community; the Black Voice Carta Latina (BVCL) was a later Black/Hispanic student publication at Rutgers, suggesting a lineage of Black student media on campus. The Scarlet & Black Research Center at Rutgers documents Black voices at the university and may have records. Rutgers University Special Collections and University Archives would be the most likely repository for this student publication. Livingston College, established in 1969 as Rutgers' most diverse residential college, was a hub for Black student activism and publications during this era.",

The story follows Prince Najee M'Witu, who secretly dons the Falcon Shadow suit of armor (created with his inventor friend Buni Mandella) to protect the high-tech African metropolis of Egyptica from the villain Terror Supreme. Armed with the power of the Black Flame and mastery of the African martial art Kupigani Ngumi, Captain Africa was a pioneering Black superhero of the early 1990s independent comics movement. The series ran three issues (#1 June 1992, #2 October 1993, #3 February 1994) plus an ashcan #0, published through African Prince Productions and Diehard Studios. A graphic novel adaptation, 'Captain Africa: The Battle for Egyptica,' was also published by Africa World Press. Issues are now extremely rare collectors' items.

The magazine was a glossy, visually engaging teen publication featuring hip-hop and R&B artist interviews, pin-ups, fashion tips, a pen pals section called 'Pass the Word,' crossword puzzles, and song lyrics. Principal photographer was Ernie Paniccioli. Word Up! was famously immortalized by The Notorious B.I.G. in 'Juicy' (1994): 'It was all a dream; I used to read Word Up! magazine.' Rap Masters was its sister publication, both produced by Faces Magazines in Paramus. The magazine circulated from 1987-2012, proving indispensable in launching careers of countless hip-hop and R&B legends. In the 2020s, Cynthia Horner (former Right On! editor-in-chief) purchased both titles, forming Right On! Media Holdings, LLC. In 2023, the Notorious B.I.G. Estate partnered with Budweiser to release limited-edition tribute issues (5,000 copies each) during Hip-Hop 50 celebrations.",

      "historicalNotes": "Gospel Today was founded in 1989 by Dr. Teresa Hairston as a four-page newsletter, launched with just $300 while she was a divorced mother of three working two jobs. The newsletter grew into the longest-running and most widely distributed Urban Christian Lifestyle magazine in history. In 1992, Hairston launched companion publication SCOREBOARD (a gospel music industry trade journal), which later became Gospel Industry Today. Content expanded from gospel music coverage to all aspects of Christian lifestyle, featuring interviews with Denzel Washington, Whitney Houston, Evander Holyfield, Jesse Jackson, and others. At its peak, Gospel Today had a circulation of 240,000. In 2008, Lifeway Christian Bookstores pulled the magazine from shelves after it featured women pastors on its cover, conflicting with Southern Baptist beliefs. The magazine never fully recovered. Hairston stepped down in 2011, passing leadership to her son Roland T. Hairston II. The magazine transitioned to digital-only before ceasing operations circa 2013. Hairston also created the Gospel Today TV show (Word TV network) and founded the Gospel Heritage Foundation (1994). Her archival collection, including magazines, audio interviews, 5,000+ sound recordings, and promotional materials, was donated to Indiana University's Archives of African American Music and Culture (AAAMC) in 2016. Hairston published her memoir 'Unstoppable' in 2021.",

Two issues were published in 1987: Vol. 1, Issue One (Winter 1987) and Vol. 1, Issue Two (Spring 1987). Each issue was in 8.5x11 inch stapled wraps, running 30-34 pages. Issue One contained poetry on Black life, Black uplift, and Black alienation. Issue Two explored the political landscape with a pan-African scope, featuring poems including 'Apartheid,' 'Why Malcolm Had to Leave,' 'Frustrations of a NeoRevolutionary,' and 'Political FatCats.' Notable contributor Sonia Sanchez contributed 'MIA's (Missing in action and other atlantas).' The journal is extremely rare: only four institutional holdings are recorded in OCLC (Rutgers University, New York Public Library, Williams College, and Newark Public Library). No copies are known to be in commerce. The journal represents Montclair's role as a center of Black literary activity in northern New Jersey during the 1980s.",
